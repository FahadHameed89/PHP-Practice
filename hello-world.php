<?php
// 'echo' and 'print' are function we can use to output strings as responses...!
/**
 * in PHP, functions do not care about case sensitivity. echo = ECHO = eChO in terms of validity...!
 * 
 */
echo "Hello World...in PHP!";

/**
 * Variable names start with a Dollar-sign ($)
 * Note that unlike functions, they ARE case sensitive...!
 * Also, don't start them with numbers or special characters...!

$studentName = "\n\nFahad";

echo $studentName;
